Website backup for new Startup Exchange Website (2021) which can be found at https://startup.exchange
static page can be accessed at https://mohitpinninti.github.io (aka, what all this html is for)


Notes: 
1. Website was converted to static for this backup so there may be some minor things that don't work
2. One of said minor things includes all of the aboslute references for button links, especially those that lead to anchor links
  2a. However, at the time of writing this, all of the referenced links seem to work.
3. Footer specifically may have some unfinished links, waiting for Carter to get back to me on what he wants for the rest of those.
4. There should be a folder called "wordpress - php backup", which should contain all of the original wordpress php files from the server (it's not used in the static page
    aka https://mohitpinninti.github.io). This will actually be used as a backup in case something happens to the server.
